# Brock University Primo Customization Package

Download the source code, and use the instructions found on the <a href="https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-devenv">developer github</a> to set the local environment up

## Unique Features

  - <b>Report a Problem</b>: Profile level error reporting feature that uses a form built into the Primo brief (expanded) and full record view of titles within Primo. Users can click a button located under the action items menu to open a form that allows a report to be submitted along with optional fields for description and contact email. On submission the form calls a Microsoft power automate flow that sends an email and updates a spreadsheet with the details of items reported to contain errors. 

## To Do

 - Add configuration section to read me outlining power automate process that handles the report delivery once past the form
 - Add installation section with instructions on adding this feature to an already customized package
